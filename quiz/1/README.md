1.	The three generations of VCS are- Local VCS, Centralized VCS, Distributed VCS. In the Local VCS everything is stored and tracked on local device. It carries the risk of total and complete data loss and makes collaboration and synchronization between team members easy. Then the centralized VCS stores data on a central server and which makes collaboration much easier but it still has the risk of total and complete data loss. Finally the distributed VCS solves all these problems as the data is stored both locally and centrally. So the risk of data loss is not there and people can still collaborate nicely.

2.	Git belongs to Distributed VCS generation.
