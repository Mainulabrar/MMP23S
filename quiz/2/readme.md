It has semantic error. getsquare is not defined.

7. 
This code does contain a logic error. Because it uses regular division which rounds of the final value. This may give erroneous result. we can solve this problem by using integer division `//`

8.
Yes, this code does contain a syntax error. Here the code is asked to print 3 index of the array. But the array has index only upto 2. 

9. 
Runtime error.
