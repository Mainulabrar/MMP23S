1.
A) The closest programming language to machine code is Assembly.
B) Yes. It requires and interpreter named Assembler.

2. 
A) Fortran
B) 1950s.

3.
C in 1970s, C++ is 1980s, MATLAB is 1980, Python in 1990s.

4.
B

5. 
C++

6.
It has semantic error. getsquare is not defined.

7. 
This code does contain a logic error. Because it uses regular division which rounds of the final value. This may give erroneous result. we can solve this problem by using integer division `//`

8.
Yes, this code does contain a syntax error. Here the code is asked to print 3 index of the array. But the array has index only upto 2. 

9. 
Runtime error.

10.
For 32 bit it is 10^38 and for 64 bit it is 10^308

11.
For 32 bit, largest is +127, smallest is -126
For 64 bit, largest is +1023, smallest if -1022

real32 can present 4,278,190,080 real numbers.
Number of subnormal values are 16777214. 
number of infinite values are 2.
number of nan values are 16777216.
Infinity = all the exponent 1
subnormal = all exponent are zero but signifants are all not zero.

14.
Because they are highly sensative to initial condition and often nonlinear and complex.

15.
Mutable objects' value can be changed after creation but immutable objects' value can not be changed after creation.

16.

21. 
Because lists creates a lot of memory for all the indices when they are created. And always reading and writing with such large chunks of memory is slow. That is why lists are unsuitable.

22.
i. Conditional Branching
ii. Looping
iii. Ability to manipulate memory.
